                <p class="w3-text-black">
                    The first lighthouse established in America was on Little Brewster Island in Boston 
                    Harbor and was first lit on September 14, 1716. A tonnage tax of 1 penny 
                    per ton on all vessels, except coasters, moving in or out of Boston Harbor, paid for 
                    maintaining the light. The first keeper, George Worthylake, with a salary of £50 a year, also acted as 
                    pilot for vessels entering the harbor. In 1718 he and his wife and daughter, with two men, were drowned 
                    when the lighthouse boat capsized as they were returning to the island from Boston. Young Benjamin Franklin, 
                    then a printer in Boston, wrote a ballad about the incident entitled "Lighthouse Tragedy" and sold it 
                    on the streets of Boston.

                    In 1774 the British took over the island and in 1775 the harbor was blocked and the
                    lighthouse became useless. On July 20, 1775, a small detachment of American troops
                    under Major Voss visited the island and burned the wooden parts of the lighthouse.
                    The British began to repair it under a marine guard, when General George Washington
                    dispatched Major Tupper with 300 men in whale-boats on July 31, 1775, who defeated
                    the guard and destroyed the repair work done. They were intercepted on leaving by
                    British small boats and attacked. A direct hit on one of the English boats by an
                    American field piece on Nantasket Head, caused the British to retire to their boats
                    with comparatively heavy losses. Only one American was killed. Major Tupper and his
                    men were commended by General Washington. When the British left Boston, March 17, 1776,
                    a number of their ships remained in the harbor. On June 13, 1776, American soldiers
                    landed on Long Island, Boston Harbor, and at Nantasket Hill and opened fire on this
                    fleet who were soon at their mercy. Before sailing away, the British sent a boat ashore
                    at Boston Light and left a time charge which blew up the lighthouse. The top of the old
                    lighthouse was used to supply ladles for American cannon.
