                    <ul>
                        <li> 1716 - First lighthouse built in the United States was Boston Lighthouse built on Little Brewster Island. This lighthouse was destroyed during the Revolutionary War and was rebuilt in 1783 and still stands today.</li>
                        <li> 1719 - First Fog Signal was a cannon placed near Boston Lighthouse. When there was fog, the cannon would be constantly fired to warn ships away from the rocky ledges.</li>
                        <li> 1789 - The United States Lighthouse Establishment was created and operated under the Department of the Treasury. This was the Ninth Law as well as the first Public Works Act passed by Congress on August 7 of that year. Because of this, every August 7th is National Lighthouse Day. This law also passed ownership and responsibility of all lighthouses to the federal government. Prior to that the lighthouses were built and owned by the individual states or territories.</li>
                        <li> 1791 - The first lighthouse completed under the ownership of the federal government was completed at Portland Head Light in Maine. Construction had been actually started and funded by the State of Massachusetts.</li>
                        <li> 1792 - Cape Henry Lighthouse, Virginia, became the first lighthouse built and completed by the Federal Government.</li>
                        <li> 1793 - First Lightship approved by President George Washington; it would be used on the Delaware River.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1818 - First lighthouses on the Great Lakes were established at Buffalo, NY on Lake Erie and Presque Isle, PA, also on Lake Erie.</li>
                        <li>1840 - The first Lighthouse Tender of the U.S. Lighthouse Service started service. It was the former U.S. Revenue Service Cutter RUSH. Prior to this date other government vessels and private vessels were used to maintain buoys and supply lighthouses. This practice continued until the Lighthouse Service had enough ships to perform the job on their own.</li>
                        <li>1841 - The first Fresnel lens used in a United States lighthouse was imported from France and installed in Navesink Lighthouse in New Jersey.</li>
                        <li>1854 - First lighthouse on the Pacific coast was completed on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay.</li>
                        <li>1884 - The first use of electricity for lighthouse purposes was at the Hell Gate Lighthouse at the Hell Gate Passage, East River, Long Island Sound, New York. <br /> It was discontinued the same year because it was too bright.</li>
                        <li>1910 - Name Change. An act of Congress abolished the Lighthouse Board and created the Bureau of Lighthouses to be in charge of all lighthouses, thus changing its operating name from the United States Lighthouse Establishment (USLHE) to the United States Lighthouse Service (USHLS). Under the new law the first Commissioner of Lighthouses, George R. Putnam, took office.</li>
